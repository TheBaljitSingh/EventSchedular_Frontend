Certainly! Working with JSON Server and exploring its capabilities can uncover several interesting features and techniques. Here are a few more things you might find useful or intriguing:

### 1. **Sorting Data**
You can sort the data returned from JSON Server based on a specific field, such as `salary` or `title`. Here’s how you can do it using `curl`:

```bash
# Sort by salary in descending order
curl "http://localhost:4000/jobs?_sort=salary&_order=desc"

# Sort by title in ascending order
curl "http://localhost:4000/jobs?_sort=title&_order=asc"
```

- **Explanation**: 
  - `_sort` specifies the field to sort by (`salary` or `title`).
  - `_order` specifies the order (`asc` for ascending, `desc` for descending).

### 2. **Filtering Data**
You can filter data based on multiple criteria using query parameters:

```bash
# Filter by location and salary range
curl "http://localhost:4000/jobs?location=Portland,%20OR&salary_gte=90000"
```

- **Explanation**:
  - `location=Portland,%20OR` filters jobs located in Portland, OR.
  - `salary_gte=90000` filters jobs with a salary greater than or equal to $90,000 (`_gte` stands for "greater than or equal to").

### 3. **Pagination**
JSON Server supports pagination using `_page` and `_limit` parameters:

```bash
# Get jobs from page 2 with 5 items per page
curl "http://localhost:4000/jobs?_page=2&_limit=5"
```

- **Explanation**:
  - `_page=2` specifies the page number.
  - `_limit=5` specifies the number of items per page.

### 4. **Generating Unique IDs**
If you need to add new entries to your JSON data, JSON Server can generate unique IDs for you:

```bash
# Example POST request to add a new job
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "title": "New Job Title",
  "type": "Full-Time",
  "location": "New City, NC",
  "salary": "$80K - $90K",
  "company": {
    "name": "New Company",
    "description": "A new company description",
    "contactEmail": "contact@newcompany.com",
    "contactPhone": "555-555-5555"
  }
}' "http://localhost:4000/jobs"
```

- **Explanation**:
  - `-X POST` specifies a POST request.
  - `-H "Content-Type: application/json"` sets the content type to JSON.
  - `-d '{ ... }'` specifies the JSON data to send.
  - `"http://localhost:4000/jobs"` is the endpoint to which the request is sent.

### 5. **Static Files Serving**
JSON Server can also serve static files (like images or documents) from a `public` directory in your project:

```bash
# Serve static files from the public directory
json-server --watch db.json --static ./public
```

- **Explanation**:
  - `--static ./public` tells JSON Server to serve static files from the `public` directory.

### 6. **Custom Routes**
You can define custom routes and behaviors using JSON Server’s `routes` feature in your `db.json` file:

```json
{
  "routes": {
    "/api/jobs/:id/comments": "/comments?jobId=:id"
  },
  "jobs": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "title": "Senior React Developer",
      ...
    }
  ],
  "comments": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "jobId": "1",
      "text": "This job looks exciting!"
    }
  ]
}
```

- **Explanation**:
  - This example defines a custom route `/api/jobs/:id/comments` that maps to `/comments?jobId=:id`, allowing you to fetch comments for a specific job ID.

### 7. **Middleware**
JSON Server supports middleware functions for handling requests before they reach the JSON server:

```javascript
const jsonServer = require('json-server');
const server = jsonServer.create();
const router = jsonServer.router('db.json');
const middlewares = jsonServer.defaults();

server.use(middlewares);
server.use((req, res, next) => {
  if (req.method === 'POST') {
    req.body.createdAt = Date.now();
  }
  next();
});

server.use(router);
server.listen(4000, () => {
  console.log('JSON Server is running');
});
```

- **Explanation**:
  - `server.use((req, res, next) => { ... })` defines a middleware function that adds a `createdAt` field to POST requests before they are processed by JSON Server.

These are just a few examples of what you can do with JSON Server. Experimenting with these features can provide a deeper understanding and help you leverage JSON Server effectively in your projects.
